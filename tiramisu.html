<h2>Step 1:Separate the whites from the yolks of 3 large eggs into two different bowls</h2>
<p>Use a large bowl for the egg white and a smaller bowl for the yolk. Make sure that none of the yolk gets mixed with the egg white; otherwise the egg whites won't whisk properly.</p>
</div> 
  <div class="step1">
</div>
 
 
<div class="textSection">
<h2>Step 2:Whisk the egg yolks with an electronic whisk.</h2>
<p>Gradually add sugar until the egg yolk becomes thick, creamy, and light yellow.</p>
</div> 
<div class="step2">

<h2>Step 3:Add Mascarpone Cheese</h2>
<p>Put about 500 grams (~12.3 oz.) of Mascarpone Cheese into another bowl. Give it a quick stir to loosen it up. Then, with the electronic whisk, mix the egg yolks and Mascarpone together.</p>

<h2>Step 4:Whisk the egg whites until they form firm peaks.</h2>
<p>Wash and dry your whisk and then whisk the egg whites until they form firm peaks. Continue to fold the egg whites into the Mascarpone and mix until there are no lumps.</p>

<h2>Step 8:Making one more layer</h2>
<p>Dip more lady fingers into the rest of your coffee mix (don't worry if you run out; you can just knock up some more). Carefully place them over the top of the cocoa.</p>
